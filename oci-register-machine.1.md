## NAME
oci-register-machine - Register OCI containers with systemd-machined

## SYNOPSIS

**oci-register-machine**

## DESCRIPTION

`oci-register-machine` is a OCI hook program. If you add it to the runc json data
as a hook, runc will execute the application after the container process is created but before it is executed, with a `prestart` flag.  When the container exits
`oci-register-machine` will be executed, after the container exits but before it is destroyed, with the `poststop` flag.  Docker will execute `oci-register-machine` as a container hook when it is installed in the $HOOKSDIR directory.

After starting an OCI container, the container will be listed with the `machinectl`.  The machine name will be the container ID.  Machinectl will then be able
to manage the container. When container exits, the oci-register-machine will remove the instance from machinectl.

## Config File

**/etc/oci-register-machine.conf**

Disable oci-register-machine by setting the `disabled` field to true.

Setup service to not fail if it can not register a container by setting the `permissive` field to true.

## EXAMPLES

	$ docker run --it busybox /bin/sh

	(In different terminal):
	
	$ machinectl
